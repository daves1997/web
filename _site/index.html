      <article><p>Transport forecasting is the nexus of transport modeling practice and “real money on the table”. Please be aware that information on this site focuses on infrastructure and operational projects/investments, not the accuracy of policy-oriented forecasts.</p>

<p>Please notify the site manager at dave -at- transportforecastaccuracy.com if you notice something missing or incorrect. We strive to detect and correct errors quickly.</p>

<p>Objective: Provide all available, reliable information and reference links that discuss travel forecasting accuracy and forecasting methods to accelerate identification of forecasting challenges and good forecasting practices.</p>

<h3 id="library-of-useful-predictedactual-studies">LIBRARY OF USEFUL PREDICTED/ACTUAL STUDIES</h3>

<p>These are studies that compare forecasted and observed values, and investigate reasons why the forecast was or was not accurate.</p>

<h3 id="ready-to-use-forecasting-products">READY-TO-USE FORECASTING PRODUCTS</h3>

<p>This section contains material summarizing the information from the libraries. This material is meant for immediate use by forecasters, policy makers and the public.</p>

<h3 id="library-of-useful-forecasting-articlespapers">LIBRARY OF USEFUL FORECASTING ARTICLES/PAPERS</h3>

<p>These are articles, presentations or papers related to forecasting practice or methodology. Please be aware that much of this material is not from transportation planning. This is because transport forecasting is not a fully mature practice at this time, and also because there appear to be more consistencies between forecasters across industries than between travel forecasters and the transportation industry.</p>
