<p>Methodological analyses of travel forecasts are now becoming more prevalent. Current reviews are typically focused on a particular mode or sub-mode. Transit forecasts are regularly reviewed and the results are publicly released. The accuracy of forecasts for tolled facilities have been regularly reviewed, but there has not been a known public release of such results in a decade. Non-tolled roadway forecasts are reviewed sporadically. Given the sheer number of these projects it is alarming that accuracy of these forecasts is not regularly analyzed and the results not publicly disseminated. The UK’s Highways Agency in the Department for Transport, through their Post-Opening Project Evaluation (POPE) program, is the only known regular analytical review of non-tolled roadway forecasts in North America and Europe.</p>

<p>Brief Synthesis
One of the first examples of an in-depth analysis of predictions of a major large-scale infrastructure investments was Webber’s 1976 study on San Francisco’s construction of the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) system. BART was the first rail system constructed in an United States city whose dominant mode was the automobile. Webber analyzed virtually all forecast assumptions and predicted benefits. Other studies sponsored by research and government agencies also provided insights.</p>

<p>Similar, but smaller scale, comparisons were made on other projects in the 1980s. A British study in 1981 examined the forecasts of 44 projects constructed between 1962-1971. The authors found no evidence that more recent or sophisticated modeling methods produced more accurate forecasts than earlier or more straightforward methods. In North America, the United States Department of Transportation produced a report in 1989 that examined the accuracy of 10 major transit investments funded by the federal government. This report, which came to be known in the industry as the “Pickrell Report”, caused a public stir by its findings: most projects under-achieved their projected ridership, while simultaneously accruing capital and operating costs larger than expected. While the Pickrell Report and a number of other accuracy evaluations are focused on transit projects, the resulting criticism often extends to travel forecasting in general.</p>

<p>The first examination into the reasons of travel forecast inaccuracy was an examination of the psychological biases in decision making under uncertainty in 1977. Kahneman and Tversky proposed the concept of the “inside view”, where intimate involvement with a project’s details during its planning and development phases leads to systemic over-estimates of its benefits and under-estimates of its costs. This was the first recognition of a systematic flaw in planning that is called ‘optimism bias’ in today’s literature. Kahneman and Tversky suggested the use of reference classes to correct these biases. Reference Class Forecasting is the use of the base-rate and distribution results from similar situations in the past to improve forecast accuracy. The benefits of reference class forecasting were suggested in subsequent work by the United States Department of Transportation, Flyvbjerg and Schmitt to correct for biases in demand and cost forecasts.</p>

<p>The number of forecasting accuracy assessments have increased since the year 2000. Bent Flyvbjerg released his seminal work on forecasts for multiple modes. Released in 2005, his article noted that demand forecasts were generally inaccurate and not becoming more accurate over time. His conclusions were based on over 210 transportation projects from across the world. He identified potential causes for this inaccuracy, including inaccurate assumptions and exogenous forecasts (tied to the concept of optimism bias), deliberately slanted forecasts, issues with the analytical tools and issues with construction or operation. Flyvbjerg suggested on way to improve forecast inaccuracy is to develop and apply reference classes to projects with large uncertainties.</p>

<p>From 2002-2005, Standard &amp; Poor’s publicly released annual reports on the accuracy of toll road, bridge and tunnel projects worldwide. The 2005 report (Bain and Polakovic 2005), the most recent report available publicly, analyzed 104 projects. They found that the demand forecasts for those projects were optimistically biased, and this bias persisted into the first five years of operation. They also found that variability of truck forecasts was much higher than lighter vehicles. The authors noted that their sample “undoubtedly reflects an over-representation of toll facilities with higher credit quality” and that actual demand accuracy for these types of projects is probably lower than documented in their report.</p>

<p>In their 2004 report (Bain and Plantagie 2004), Standard and Poor’s noted optimism bias in forecasts of toll facilities versus non-tolled roadways. The accuracy of non-tolled roads, based on a sample of over 150 projects from Flyvbjerg’s database, was much better than toll road forecasts - with some projects heavily under-forecasting demand. They found generally a 20-30 percentage point skew (optimism bias) between the two sets of forecasts, and noted this was consistent with their previous studies.</p>

<p>The National Cooperative Highway Research Program (NCHRP) released a synthesis on estimated toll road demand and revenue in 2006. This study reported the accuracy of 26 toll road revenue forecasts, finding that forecast accuracy does not improve over time. It noted that “many of the problems that had been identified with the performance of traffic and revenue forecasts were related to the application of the model, less so to methods and algorithms”.</p>

<p>There have been a few recent studies examining the accuracy of non-tolled roadway forecasts. Parthasarathi and Levinson (2010) examined the accuracy of traffic forecasts for one city in Minnesota. Giaimo and Byram (2013) examined the accuracy of over 2,000 traffic forecasts in Ohio produced between 2000-2012. They found the traffic forecasts slightly high, but within the standard error of the traffic count data. They did not find any systematic problems with erroneous forecasts. The presentation also described an automated forecasting tool for “low risk” projects that relies on trendlines of historical traffic counts and adjustments following procedures outlined in NCHRP Report 255 and updated in NCHRP Report 765.</p>

<p>The Federal Transit Administration has conducted two additional studies analyzing predicted and actual outcomes of large-scale federally funded transit projects, one in 2003 (Federal Transit Administration 2003) and another in 2007. The FTA is finding that transit forecasts are becoming more accurate over time, and attribute that improvement to better scrutiny of travel forecasts and the analytical tools used to produce the forecasts.</p>

<p>Schmitt presented the results of his analysis of all forecasts of project New Starts built in the United States through 2011. The forecasts were incorporated into the Transit Forecasting Accuracy Database (TFAD). The database contained 65 large-scale transit infrastructure projects from around the country. The research found that transit project assumptions have historical bias towards over-forecasting ridership. Using these data, Schmitt statistically identified 3 reference classes for transit forecasting.</p>

<p>The research also investigated three commonly held beliefs regarding forecasting accuracy:</p>

<ol>
  <li>More recent projects are more accurate than older ones (i.e., we are getting more accurate as tools become more advanced),</li>
  <li>Forecasts are more accurate in later stages of project development than in earlier stages (i.e., the more we know about the details of a project the more accurate we can forecast demand), and</li>
  <li>Forecasts of smaller changes to the transit system are more accurate than larger changes (i.e., smaller changes are easier to predict than larger changes).</li>
</ol>

<p>Schmitt found that only the first commonly held belief had merit. Transit forecasts, on average, are biased but have been – slowly and non-monotonically – becoming more accurate over time.</p>

<p>By the mid-2000s, some studies attempted to identify issues with forecasting practice or the associated analytical methods. NCHRP Special Report 288 noted that “current practice in travel forecasting has several deficiencies that often diminish the value of these forecasts”. SR 288 identified four areas of deficiency: inherent weaknesses of the models themselves, errors introduced by modeling and forecasting practice, the lack or questionable reliability of data, and biases arising from the institutional climate in which models are used. The Travel Model Improvement Program released two reports to assist with these areas in 2013, “Improving Existing Travel Models and Forecasting Processes: A White Paper” and “Managing Uncertainty and Risk in Travel Forecasting: A White Paper”.</p>

<h2 id="ongoing-systematic-reviews">Ongoing Systematic Reviews</h2>

<p>Although individual studies analyzing the accuracy of travel forecasts are becoming more and more prevalent today, programs of forecast reviews are still rare. There are only three well-known re-occurring programs dedicated to reviewing predicted and actual outcomes already in practice.</p>

<p>The UK’s Highways Agency in the Department for Transport, through their Post-Opening Project Evaluation (POPE) program (Highways Agency 2013), is the only known regular analytical review of non-tolled roadway forecasts in North America and Europe. It is by far the most impressive review of roadway forecasts. The HA conducts a regular review of roadway forecasts, assessing the accuracy of demand, costs, accident, and travel time benefit forecasts. Over the past 11 years, the HA has reviewed smaller roadway projects (i.e., less than 10M British pounds). The HA also reviews large projects (i.e., greater than 10M British pounds) one and five years after each project’s opening. A meta-analysis across all recent large projects occurs every two years.</p>

<p>The FTA’s Capital Investment Grant program, commonly known as the “New Starts” program, requires Before and After Studies for every major project funded through the program. Project sponsors are directed to archive the predictions and details supporting the predictions at two planning stages and at the federal funding decision stage. Approximately two years after project opening, project sponsors are required to gather information about the actual outcomes of five major aspects of the project: physical scope, capital cost, transit service levels, operating and maintenance costs and ridership. Project sponsors analyze the predictions and actual outcomes, and prepare a report summarizing the differences between the predictions and actual outcomes, documenting the reasons for those differences, and highlighting lessons learned that would inform FTA or other project sponsors on how methodologies or circumstances helped or hindered the predictions.</p>

<p>FTA’s New Starts program allows project sponsors to enumerate the uncertainties inherent in their travel forecasts, and provide information on how those uncertainties may impact the project forecast. FTA has presented the method of “build up” of uncertainties, with separate forecasts produced for individual sources of uncertainty, to help identify the key drivers of uncertainty from the travel model’s perspective. Similar approaches could be considered for highway projects.</p>
