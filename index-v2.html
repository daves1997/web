title: Transport Forecast Accuracy
permalink: /
---

Transport forecasting is the nexus of transport modeling practice and &quot;real
money on the table&quot;. Please be aware that information on this site focuses
on infrastructure and operational projects/investments, as almost no one pays
serious attention to the accuracy of policy-oriented forecasts. Please notify
site manager at daves1997 -at- gmail.com if you notice something missing or
incorrect. We strive to detect and correct errors quickly. Our objective:
Provide all available, reliable information and reference links that discuss
travel forecasting accuracy and forecasting methods to accelerate identification
of forecasting challenges and good forecasting practices. ## Main Topics ###
LIBRARY OF USEFUL PREDICTED/ACTUAL STUDIES These are studies that compare
forecasted and observed values, and investigate reasons why the forecast was or
was not accurate. ### LIBRARY OF USEFUL FORECASTING ARTICLES/PAPERS These are
articles, presentations or papers related to forecasting practice or
methodology. Please be aware that some material may not be in a transportation
context. This is because transport forecasting is not a fully mature practice at
this time, and also because there appear to be more consistencies between
forecasters across industries than between travel forecasters and the
transportation industry. ### READY-TO-USE FORECASTING PRODUCTS This section
contains material summarizing the information from the libraries. This material
is meant for immediate use by forecasters, policy makers and the public.
