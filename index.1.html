<h2>TransportForecastAccuracy.com</h2>

<p>Transport forecasting is the nexus of transport modeling practice and &quot;real money on the table&quot;. Please be aware that information on this site focuses on infrastructure and operational projects/investments, as almost no one pays serious attention to the accuracy of policy-oriented forecasts. </p>

<p>Please notify site manager at daves1997 -at- gmail.com if you notice something missing or incorrect. We strive to detect and correct errors quickly. </p>

<p>Our objective: Provide all available, reliable information and reference links that discuss travel forecasting accuracy and forecasting methods to accelerate identification of forecasting challenges and good forecasting practices. </p>

<h3>Main Topics</h3>

<p>LIBRARY OF USEFUL PREDICTED/ACTUAL STUDIES - These are studies that compare forecasted and observed values, and investigate reasons why the forecast was or was not accurate. </p>

<p>LIBRARY OF USEFUL FORECASTING ARTICLES/PAPERS - These are articles, presentations or papers related to forecasting practice or methodology. Please be aware that some material may not be in a transportation context. This is because transport forecasting is not a fully mature practice at this time, and also because there appear to be more consistencies between forecasters across industries than between travel forecasters and the transportation industry. </p>

<p>READY-TO-USE FORECASTING PRODUCTS - This section contains material summarizing the information from the libraries. This material is meant for immediate use by forecasters, policy makers and the public. </p>
