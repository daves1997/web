<h3>Predicted/Actual Studies</h3>

<h4>Brief Synthesis</h4>

<p>The methodological review of travel forecasts appear to begin in the late 1980s. The United States Department of Transportation produced a report in 1989 that examined the accuracy of major transit investments funded by the federal government. This report<sup><a id="ffn1" href="#fn1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>, which came to be known as the &quot;Pickrell Report&quot;, caused a public stir by its findings: most projects under-achieved their projected ridership, while simultaneously accruing capital and operating costs larger than expected. The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) conducted two subsequent studies, one in 2003<sup><a id="ffn2" href="#fn2" class="footnote">2</a></sup> and another in 2008<sup><a id="ffn3" href="#fn3" class="footnote">3</a></sup>, that analyzed transit projects constructed since the Pickrell Report was released. The FTA continues today to regularly analyze and report the accuracy of project demand and cost forecasts, releasing <a href="http://www.fta.dot.gov/12907_9197.html" title="FTA&#39;s Before/After Reports">Before/After reports annually to Congress</a>. These efforts make the FTA a key leader in the field of travel forecasting.</p>

<p>The 2000s saw a flurry of travel forecasting reviews, besides the two FTA reports mentioned in the above paragraph. Bent Flyvbjerg released the seminal work on forecasts for all modes and forms of transportation. Released in 2005 in the <strong>Journal of the American Planning Association</strong>, &quot;How (In)accurate Are Demand Forecasts in Public Works Projects?: The Case of Transportation&quot; noted that demand forecasts were generally inaccurate and not becoming more accurate<sup><a id="ffn4" href="#fn4" class="footnote">4</a></sup>. Flyvbjerg has promoted and applied alternative forecasting strategies to combat optimism bias in demand forecasts, releasing or co-writing articles and books on the subject.</p>

<p>The Transportation Research Board (TRB) released a synthesis report on toll road forecasting, with one section reporting the accuracy of 26 toll road revenue forecasts<sup><a id="ffn5" href="#fn5" class="footnote">5</a></sup>. Their findings generally agreed with Flyvbjerg&#39;s results, which covered a wider range of transportation modes and construction years.</p>

<p>From 2002-2005, Standard &amp; Poor&#39;s publicly released annual reports on the accuracy of toll road, bridge and tunnel projects worldwide. The 2005 report, the most recent report available publicly, analyzed 104 projects. They found that the demand forecasts for those projects were optimistically biased, and this bias persisted into the first five years of operation. They also found that variability of truck forecasts was much higher than lighter vehicles. It should be noted that the author&#39;s noted their sample &quot;undoubtedly reflects an over-representation of toll facilities with higher credit quality&quot;, and that actual demand accuracy for these types of projects is probably lower than documented in their report. </p>

<p>In their 2004 report, Standard and Poor&#39;s noted optimism bias in forecasts of toll facilities versus non-tolled roadways. The accuracy of non-tolled roads, based on a sample of over 150 projects from Flyvbjerg&#39;s database, was much better than toll road forecasts - with some projects heavily under-forecasting demand. They found generally a 20-30 percentage point skew (optimism bias) between the two sets of forecasts, and noted this was consistent with their previous studies. </p>

<p>Other reviews of non-toll roadway forecasts have occurred within the past seven years. In 2009, Parthasarathi and Levinson examined 108 non-tolled roadway projects in the Minneapolis area. They examined forecast accuracy for different levels of roadway demand and existing and new facilities. Over-forecasting was more common for smaller roadways (&lt;20k AADT), while under-forecasting was common for larger roadways (30+k AADT). For the 83 projects on existing roadways, the forecasting accuracy ratio (actual demand divided by forecast demand) is 0.83. For the 25 projects on new roadways, the forecasting accuracy ratio is 1.05. These results are different from Standard and Poor&#39;s analysis. In 2013, Ohio DOT reviewed the 2000-2012 forecasts of 2,100 non-toll roadway projects. They reported that overall the forecasts were within 20% of actual demand, although no specific accuracy rate was presented. </p>

<p>By far the most impressive review of roadway forecasts has been conducted by the United Kingdom&#39;s Highways Agency (HA), within the Department for Transport. The HA has conducted a regular review of roadway forecasts, assessing the accuracy of demand, costs, accident, and travel time benefit forecasts. Over the past 11 years, the HA has reviewed smaller roadway projects (i.e., less than 10M British pounds). The HA also reviews large projects (greater than 10M British pounds) one and five years after each project&#39;s opening. A meta-analysis across all recent large projects occurs every two years.</p>

<h4>Summary</h4>

<p>Methodological analyses of travel forecasts are now more prevalent than at any time in the past. Current reviews are typically focused on a particular mode or sub-mode. Transit forecasts are regularly reviewed and the results are publicly released. The accuracy of forecasts for tolled facilities have been regularly reviewed, but there has not been a known public release of such results in a decade. Non-tolled roadway forecasts are reviewed sporadically. Given the sheer number of these projects it is alarming that accuracy of these forecasts is not regularly analyzed and the results not publicly disseminated. The UK&#39;s Highways Agency in the Department for Transport, through their Post-Opening Project Evaluation (POPE) program, is the only known regular analytical review of non-tolled roadway forecasts in North America and Europe.</p>
