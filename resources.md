Useful articles, papers and books related to the science and practice of forecasting will be enumerated here for easy reference. Many forecasting articles in the academic/research transportation field are actually focused on modeling
methods and associated precision. In contrast, the following articles focus on particular aspects of forecasting:

- improving forecasting methods,
- scientific analysis of forecasting methods or models,
- psychological issues that impact forecasting methods,
- forecasting ethics. and
